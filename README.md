👋 Hello, I'm Aravindh Gopalsamy!

I'm a forward-thinking graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at The University of Texas, Arlington. With a rich background in software development and a passion for emerging technologies, I'm on a mission to blend innovation with real-world impact.

🚀 As a Senior Software Developer, I led a dynamic team at Technumen, driving the design and implementation of a robust insurance policy API. My initiatives resulted in a 10% improvement in policy quoting efficiency and the identification of over 30 critical bugs, showcasing my commitment to system reliability.

🌐 Recently, I contributed my skills to ISN Software Corporation during a summer internship in Dallas, TX. There, I immersed myself in agile development at Sprint, playing a pivotal role in .NET MVC web application development. One of my key achievements was structuring an Import API using ASP .NET MVC, leading to the replacement of more than 5 existing methods and aligning with the company's API management strategies.

🛠️ My technical arsenal includes proficiency in C, Core JAVA, GOSU, Python, SQL, C#, ASP .Net MVC, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, alongside hands-on experience with EMC Xpression Design and Guidewire - PolicyCenter, BillingCenter. Certified as an Oracle Certified Associate Programmer (Java SE 8) and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: AZ-900.

🌟 I've left my mark on innovative projects such as an IoT-based weather-adaptive smart window, an Android API aiding visually impaired individuals, and a facial sketch transformation using computer vision and deep learning. Each project underscores my dedication to pushing boundaries and embracing new challenges.

💼 Previously, I served as a Senior Software Developer at Capgemini, contributing significantly to API development, client requirement implementation, and document accuracy enhancement. My journey in the tech realm began with conceptualizing and building a web-based health insurance application during my undergraduate studies.

🎓 Education-wise, I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R&D Institute of Science & Technology, Chennai, maintaining a CGPA of 8.27. Currently, I'm maintaining a strong GPA of 3.80 in my M.S. program.
